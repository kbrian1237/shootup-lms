# Dashboard Courses and Progress Fix

## Problem Identified
The dashboard.html was not displaying courses and their progress because:
1. **Missing Dashboard Script**: The HTML had `data-bind` and `data-component` attributes but no script to handle them
2. **Incompatible Dashboard Script**: The existing `courses/dashboard.js` was designed for a different authentication system
3. **No Data Population**: The dashboard components were not being populated with course data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New Dashboard Script
**File:** `dist/dashboard.js`
- **Purpose:** Handle dashboard data binding and course display for the ShootUp system
- **Features:**
  - Compatible with existing ShootUp data structure
  - Uses unified progress tracking system
  - Populates all dashboard components
  - Real-time progress updates
  - Fallback data handling

### 2. Dashboard Components Implemented

#### **Statistics Cards**
- **Total Courses**: Counts all available courses
- **Completed**: Courses with 100% progress
- **In Progress**: Courses with 1-99% progress  
- **Hours Learned**: Estimated based on progress (10 hours per course)

#### **Courses in Progress Section**
- Shows courses with active progress (1-99%)
- If no progress, shows all courses as samples
- Interactive course cards with progress bars
- Click to navigate to course details

#### **Recent Activity Section**
- Generated based on course progress
- Shows completion and progress activities
- Simulated timestamps for demo purposes
- Empty state when no activity

#### **Upcoming Deadlines Section**
- Sample deadline data for demonstration
- Formatted table with course, assignment, due date, status
- Color-coded status indicators

### 3. Progress Integration
```javascript
// Uses unified progress system
function getCourseProgress(courseId) {
    if (window.ProgressSync) {
        return window.ProgressSync.getCourseProgress(courseId);
    }
    // Fallback to direct localStorage access
    const progress = localStorage.getItem(`progress_${courseId}`);
    return progress ? Math.max(0, Math.min(100, parseInt(progress, 10))) : 0;
}
```

### 4. Real-Time Updates
- Listens for `courseProgressUpdate` events
- Automatically refreshes dashboard when progress changes
- Updates statistics and course displays in real-time

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- âœ… **Created**: `dist/dashboard.js` - New dashboard functionality
- âœ… **Updated**: `dashboard.html` - Added dashboard script
- âœ… **Created**: `test-dashboard.html` - Dashboard testing tool

### Integration Points
- âœ… Uses `window.ShootUpData.load()` for course data
- âœ… Uses unified progress tracking system
- âœ… Compatible with existing navigation system
- âœ… Responsive design with existing styles

## How It Works Now

### 1. Dashboard Loading Process
1. **Page Load**: dashboard.html loads with all required scripts
2. **Data Loading**: `window.ShootUpData.load()` fetches course data
3. **Component Initialization**: Each dashboard component is populated
4. **Progress Integration**: Current progress is retrieved and displayed
5. **Event Listeners**: Set up for real-time updates

### 2. Course Display Logic
```javascript
// Courses in Progress Logic
const coursesInProgress = courses.filter(course => {
    const progress = getCourseProgress(course.id);
    return progress > 0 && progress < 100;
});

// If no progress, show sample courses
if (displayCourses.length === 0) {
    displayCourses = courses.slice(0, 3);
}
```

### 3. Statistics Calculation
```javascript
courses.forEach(course => {
    const progress = getCourseProgress(course.id);
    
    if (progress >= 100) {
        completed++;
    } else if (progress > 0) {
        inProgress++;
    }
    
    totalHours += Math.round((progress / 100) * 10);
});
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Setup Test Data
1. Open `test-dashboard.html`
2. Click "Setup Sample Progress" to create test data
3. Click "Open Dashboard" to view results

### 2. Verify Dashboard Components
1. **Statistics**: Should show correct counts based on progress
2. **Courses in Progress**: Should display courses with progress bars
3. **Recent Activity**: Should show activity based on progress
4. **Deadlines**: Should show sample deadline data

### 3. Test Real-Time Updates
1. Open dashboard in one tab
2. Open a course and make progress
3. Return to dashboard - should update automatically

### 4. Test Different Scenarios
- **No Progress**: Dashboard should show sample courses
- **Some Progress**: Should show accurate statistics
- **Completed Courses**: Should appear in completed count

## Expected Dashboard Display

### With Sample Progress Data:
- **Total Courses**: 5 (or actual course count)
- **Completed**: 1 (courses with 100% progress)
- **In Progress**: 3 (courses with 1-99% progress)
- **Hours Learned**: Calculated based on progress

### Courses in Progress Section:
- Interactive course cards with:
  - Course title and icon
  - Progress bar showing completion percentage
  - "Continue" button linking to course details

### Recent Activity Section:
- Activity items showing:
  - Course completion or progress updates
  - Simulated timestamps
  - Appropriate icons and colors

## Benefits Achieved
